        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <h3 class="left-align">Good Website: <a href="https://ambiq.com/" target="_blank">Ambiq</a></h3>
        <p>
            Ambiq is a technology company who strives for innovation by reducing the total battery power used for their devices.
        </p>
        <ol class="left-align">
            <li>C - the site follows a nice simple contrast of black on white with a splash of blue. Headers are large enough to distinguish from body text. This contrast is a good example of readability and the blue is not overbearing.</li>
            <li>R - the site retains its color scheme throughout each page. In addition, a large animated element of a device is shown with the corresponding page, creating unity.</li>
            <li>A - the navigation bar and sections are aligned appropriately, while certain images overlap the grid, but its not distracting. The only exception might be the "About Us" page where the timeline is shown in a checker format, but still clean.</li>    
            <li>P - every header has a corresponding body of text and/or image that relates to the text next to it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="left-align">Bad Website: <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
        <p>
            This site is dedicated to the School of Art department at Yale. The site exists as a collaborative information sharing experiment and therefore, faculty, staff, and students are allowed to add new content on this site.</p>
        <ol class="left-align">
            <li>C - the site does not follow a certain color scheme and the contrast is all over the place. This is an example of bad readability. In case the design was not intentional, all collaborators should be told what color scheme and format to follow.</li>
            <li>R - since there are different collaborators, there is not a lot of repetition of elements since each person has a different style. Each section is almost different from each other.</li>
            <li>A - all the elements are situated on the left side of the site, but the grid within that side is very unorganized. There are text boxes of different dimensions put around each other. </li>    
            <li>P - since the site acts like a wiki, new content is added all the time as a result, different content is put together regardless. For proximity/alignment, collaborators should be told where they should content on the site.</li>
        </ol>
