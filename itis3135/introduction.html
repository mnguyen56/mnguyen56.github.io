        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, but moved to Charlotte when I was 2 years old. I like to consider myself a Charlotte native since I grew up here most of my life. Initially, I wanted to be a nurse, but ultimately went with computer science because of my interest in technology.</li>
            <li>Professional: Due to my parents, I couldn't start a job until after high school. However, I did do a few internships before graduating. One was a being a volunteer at a nursing home (before career change) and then two were coding camps. My first actual job was being a barista at a boba shop in 2019.</li>
            <li>Academic background: I graduated from Harding University High School. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Web and Mobile App Development at UNCC.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I've used computers since I was young, but discovered programming during my late junior-early senior year of highschool. It was in college that I got more interested in web development which led to me choosing this concentration!</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10 for home and school.</li>
